    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it...

I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great .

    The echo dot is a glorified alarm clock radio.The thing you'll be using it for the most is alarms, playing music through amazon music, and turning this lightbulb on and off. But the brightness of the bulb is too low to replace a proper light.Alexa also needs a lot of work. It can't hold a conversation. It is nowhere near as good as google assistant. You ask Alexa the same questions you ask google assistant, and it'll be stumped because it does not account for the previous question you asked. \"Where is Agra\" -\"India\", \"tell me more about it\" \"Sorry I don't understand\"Between this and google, you should only get this if you use amazon music/delivery/fire tv a lot, because it adds some continuity between these services. I can check where my order is via voice, but it's very general and ambiguous information (it's on the way). Some of the good skills are only available on the US version. The ones that are available, Alexa struggles to understand what I'm saying. Overall, I'm not impressed. This is my first and last Echo product. Only buy this on discount.I'm really hoping that through patches and updates, Amazon can add more features and proper functionality to this product. I would like to see that considering I own this product now.It's not the technological revolution I was hoping for, it's an expensive gadget that's fun for less than 10 minutes. I want to use it for more than alarms and music.

    Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass.
